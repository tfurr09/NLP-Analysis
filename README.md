# NLP-Analysis

This project is from my NLP class at the University of Chicago. To see it on my website go [here](https://taylorfurry.com/2024/01/03/ai-sentiment-analysis/)

The point of the project was to analyze how AI and new technology is received. We were given 200,000 recent news articles and we were to analyze them. Methods used include topic modeling, named entity recognition and sentiment analysis. Everything was done in Python.
